In this project, I used the FMP API for financial data fetching and the OpenAI Assistant API for data analysis, insights, and data interpretation. 
I used Streamlit for the frontend. 
The app analyzes stock market data and provides insights, data interpretation, and company performance. 
To use this app, you need an OpenAI API key and an FMP API key. 
You can get your OpenAI API key from here: https://openai.com/blog/openai-api 
and your FMP API key from here: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/. 
After obtaining your keys, you need to copy them into the .env file of this project. 
After copying these keys, you can open the project in Visual Studio Code and run this command: streamlit run app.py. 
You need to install Streamlit to run the project.
